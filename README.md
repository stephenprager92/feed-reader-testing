## Instructions

This repository contains Project #4 for the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. In this project, I was provided with a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite, which I was assigned to build.

In order to run this feed reader application, you'll need to download the following materials (all available within this repository):
1. index.html
2. css/
   * style.css
   * normalize.css
   * icomoon.css (includes font family and rendering)
3. js/
   * app.js
4. fonts/ (includes font family and rendering)
   * icomoon.svg
   * icomoon.eot
   * icomoon.woff
   * icomoon.tff

If you choose not to download the testing framework and test suites, you'll need to remove all references to the 'jasmine' directory from index.html. However, the testing framework and suites are strongly recommended - especially for those who intend to continue developing the application. You can access the framework through the following files (also within this repository):
1. jasmine/
   * lib/ (All files required - this includes the Jasmine framework)
   * spec/
      * feedreader.js (This includes the test suites for the feedreader application)

## Contributing

Since this project is being used as an evaluation for the Udacity FEND, at this time I am **NOT** accepting pull requests. This may change as the project and nanodegree course are completed and I look to optimize the project further, so stay tuned!
